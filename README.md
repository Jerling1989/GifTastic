# GifTastic
This is a fun app working with the Giphy API. The code used to build this app is HTML, Bootstrap CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. The page loads with some buttons the user can click on to load some Gifs regarding that topic. The user can then click on the gifs to play of pause them. They can also add more topics by filling out the form at the top of the page. It should also be noted that above each Gif there is a rating regarding the maturity level of the Gif Animation.

- This is the first screen the user will see when the page is loaded. There is a simple header, a search bar, and a selection of pre-chosen Gif Buttons. It should be noted that the gifs I chose for this project are purposely weird and wacky for humor. The user can click on each gif when they are loaded to either play or pause them.

- This is an example to show that the user can search for a new topic of Gif. After doing so a new button will appear with that topic on it and the user can click on it to load new relevant Gifs regarding that topic.
